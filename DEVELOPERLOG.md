# Week 1

### Day 1 - 6/6/2025 - Getting Setup
What I accomplished: 
- Wrote an initial READ.md file with the goals and features tailored to this project.
- Created a developerlog.md file to track and share progress
- Outlined core task features (add, list, complete, delete)
- Practiced utilizng the basic features of GitHub

What I learned: 
- How to download Git
- How to create a cloned repository onto my desktop directory
- How to create a folder on a GitHub repository

What issues that I stumbled upon:
- Creating a C++ project on GitHub
- Familiarizing myself with actually linking the JSON library to this repository and project.


How I solved/plan to solve the issue:
- I could write down my C++ code onto VS and then once I figure out a more effective way to move my code onto this platform, I could do copy-and-paste my code onto here.
- Since I'm not emphasizing the JSON library this week, I can wait until next week to concern myself with linking it to this project.

### Day 2 - 6/7/2025 - Creating Task and TaskManager Classes
What I accomplished:
- Created the actual VS Code project for this project.
- Created the Task and TaskManager classes for the program.
- Created a skeleton outline of the two classes based on the suggestion from ChatGPT, including both member variables and functions (Cautionary note: I won't rely on ChatGPT to actually implement the code for the function members. That's where I'll showcase my knowledge and application.)
- Created constant data values for the member variables of class Task.
- Implemented the code for the parameterized constructor, default constructor, display(), toggleComplete(), and getStatus() functions for class Task.

What I learned:
- How to create a C++ project on VS Code (I've always used VS Studio for programming purposes).
- How to to link the repository for this project on my desktop to VS Code.

What issues that I stumbled upon:
- Creating a C++ project on VS Code, since I've never used VS Code for C++ purposes in the past
- Debugging the code on a driver program since the debugger can't access the project on my directory.

How I solved/plan to solve the issue:
- I installed a C++ compiler and extensions just to be safe. I also Google'd how to create a C++ project on VS Code. I solved this issue successfully.
- I'll have to figure out what exactly is missing between the IDE and VS Code itself to fail in debugging my code. I'll have to use Google and identify if I overlooked an important step while setting up the programming environment.
