# Week 1

### Day 1 - 6/6/2025 - Getting Setup
What I accomplished: 
- Wrote an initial READ.md file with the goals and features tailored to this project.
- Created a developerlog.md file to track and share progress
- Outlined core task features (add, list, complete, delete)
- Practiced utilizng the basic features of GitHub

What I learned: 
- How to download Git
- How to create a cloned repository onto my desktop directory
- How to create a folder on a GitHub repository

What issues that I stumbled upon:
- Creating a C++ project on GitHub
- Familiarizing myself with actually linking the JSON library to this repository and project.


How I solved/plan to solve the issue:
- I could write down my C++ code onto VS and then once I figure out a more effective way to move my code onto this platform, I could do copy-and-paste my code onto here.
- Since I'm not emphasizing the JSON library this week, I can wait until next week to concern myself with linking it to this project.
