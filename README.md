# CLI-Task-Manager
This is a MVP CLI task manager created through C++. I'm starting this project as an opportunity to practice and enforce the object-oriented programming skills that I've developed in C++, and to add my first personal coding project to my portfolio.

A CLI task manager is a command-line tool that allows users to create, view, oganize, and track tasks or to-do items using just the terminal or console alone. GUI is not required for this. 

My CLI task manager will include the following five core features: adding a task, listing all tasks, marking a task as completed/incompleted, and saving/loading tasks from a file (via JSON). Additional features, such as organizing tasks by priority, including due dates for each task and/or colored output for readibility, will be implemented if time and willpower allows.
